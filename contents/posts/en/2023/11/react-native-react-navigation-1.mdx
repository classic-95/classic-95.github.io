Today, let's learn about screen transitions in react-native using react-navigation open source.

First, you can follow it more easily if you turn on [the official Document](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started/). 
It's nice that blog posts are simply organized, but it's a good idea to always get into the habit of reading official documents.

---

## 1. Create a project

First, let's create a project.

Open the terminal on Mac or cmd on Windows to create a react-native project.

I will create a react-native project named navigation.

```bash
# npx react-native init {your project name}
npx react-native init navigation
```

 ## 2. Install react-navigation

Let's install react-navigation along with the dependencies as stated in the official document.

 ```bash
 # cd {your project name}
 cd navigation

 # react-navigation/native and react-navigation/stack 
 # dependencies(react-native-screens, react-native-safe-area-context) of react-navigation/native
 # dependency(react-native-gesture-handler) of react-navigation/stack
 yarn add @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/stack react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context react-native-gesture-handler
 ```

 ### 2-1. ios additional actions

iOS additional work For iOS, you need to perform a pod install to connect the modules you just installed.

 ```bash
 cd ios
 pod install
 cd ..
 ```

### 2-2. android additional actions

For Android, you need to add the code below in \"{"android/app/src/main/java/<project name>/MainActivity.java"}\".

If you do not add the code below, an abnormal termination may occur when the app switches from the background to the foreground.

```java
// android/app/src/main/java/<your project name>/MainActivity.java

public class MainActivity extends ReactActivity {
  // ...
  @Override
  protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(null);
  }
  // ...
}
```

### 2-3. ios, android common tasks

Import react-native-gesture-handler, a dependency of @react-navigation/stack, from index.js.

Otherwise, errors may occur during building or problems may occur when switching screens.

```js 
// index.js

// ...
- import 'react-native-gesture-handler';
// ...
```

## 3. Create a test screen

The test screen will be structured as follows.

After creating the src/screens folder, move App.tsx that was previously in the root directory.

Likewise, create Navigator.tsx, Screen1.tsx, and Screen2.tsx files in the src/screens folder.

Also, create a Navigation.ts file to declare the type of navigation after creating the types folder.

```
üì¶src
 ‚î£ üìÇscreens
 ‚îÉ ‚î£ üìúApp.tsx
 ‚îÉ ‚î£ üìúNavigator.tsx
 ‚îÉ ‚î£ üìúScreen1.tsx
 ‚îÉ ‚îó üìúScreen2.tsx
 ‚îó üìÇtypes
 ‚îÉ ‚îó üìúNavigation.ts
```

### 3-1. Navigation.ts

Before writing any other code, specify the types of screens that exist in Naivgation.

Since we only have Screen1 and Screen2, we set the type as follows.

The undefined value of Screen1: and Screen2: means that the type required to display each screen does not exist.

I will explain this further in the next post, but will move on for now.

```ts
// src/types/Navigation.ts

export type NaviParamList = {
	Screen1: undefined;
	Screen2: undefined;
};
```

### 3-2. Screen1.tsx

There is nothing very difficult, but to add an explanation, in [3-1 above](/en/posts/2023/09/react-native-react-navigation-1/#3-1-navigationts), 
declare NavigationProp by specifying the declared NaviParamList and the current screen name.

After that, create a navigation variable that uses the NavigationProp type declared through the useNavigation hook.

Attach an onPress event to the Move to Screen-2 button to execute the function to move to Screen-2.

<img src={img1} style={{width: 250, margin: "auto", display: "block", marginBottom: 20}} alt="react-native navigation screen1" />

```tsx
// src/screens/Screen1.tsx

import { StackNavigationProp } from '@react-navigation/stack';
import React from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, Text, TouchableOpacity, View } from 'react-native';
import { NaviParamList } from '../types/Navigation';
import { useNavigation } from '@react-navigation/native';

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
	container: {
		flex: 1,
		alignItems: 'center',
		justifyContent: 'center',
	},
	button: {
		padding: 10,
		backgroundColor: 'black',
	},
	buttonLabel: {
		color: 'white',
	},
});

type NavigationProp = StackNavigationProp<NaviParamList, 'Screen1'>;

export default function Screen1() {
	const navigation = useNavigation<NavigationProp>();

	return (
		<View style={styles.container}>
			<TouchableOpacity style={styles.button} onPress={() => navigation.navigate('Screen2')}>
				<Text style={styles.buttonLabel}>Screen-2Î°ú Ïù¥Îèô</Text>
			</TouchableOpacity>
		</View>
	);
}

```

### 3-3. Screen2.tsx

It is the same as [Screen](/en/posts/2023/09/react-native-react-navigation-1/#3-2-screen1tsx) 1 above.

<img src={img2} style={{width: 250, margin: "auto", display: "block", marginBottom: 20}} alt="react-native navigation screen2"/>

```tsx
// src/screens/Screen2.tsx

import { StackNavigationProp } from '@react-navigation/stack';
import React from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, Text, TouchableOpacity, View } from 'react-native';
import { NaviParamList } from '../types/Navigation';
import { useNavigation } from '@react-navigation/native';

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
	container: {
		flex: 1,
		alignItems: 'center',
		justifyContent: 'center',
	},
	button: {
		padding: 10,
		backgroundColor: 'black',
	},
	buttonLabel: {
		color: 'white',
	},
});

type NavigationProp = StackNavigationProp<NaviParamList, 'Screen2'>;

export default function Screen2() {
	const navigation = useNavigation<NavigationProp>();

	return (
		<View style={styles.container}>
			<TouchableOpacity style={styles.button} onPress={() => navigation.navigate('Screen1')}>
				<Text style={styles.buttonLabel}>Screen-1Î°ú Ïù¥Îèô</Text>
			</TouchableOpacity>
		</View>
	);
}
```

### 3-4. Navigator.tsx

Now we need to create a navigator to connect Screen1 and Screen2 created above, right?

First, create a Stack object using createStackNavigator.

After that, enter the screens you want to include like the code below.

```tsx
// src/screens/Navigator.tsx

import React from 'react';
import { createStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/stack';
import { NaviParamList } from '../types/Navigation';
import Screen1 from './Screen1';
import Screen2 from './Screen2';

const Stack = createStackNavigator<NaviParamList>();

export default function Navigator() {
	return (
		<Stack.Navigator>
			<Stack.Screen name="Screen1" component={Screen1} />
			<Stack.Screen name="Screen2" component={Screen2} />
		</Stack.Navigator>
	);
}
```

### 3-5. Edit App.tsx

Now, after deleting all the basic codes in App.tsx, 
wrap the Navigator created above with NavigationContainer as shown in the code below.

```tsx
// src/screens/App.tsx

import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';
import React from 'react';
import Navigator from './Navigator';

export default function App() {
	return (
		<NavigationContainer>
			<Navigator />
		</NavigationContainer>
	);
}
```

### 3-6. Edit index.js

Lastly, just edit the App.tsx import path in index.js and you're done!

```diff
// ...

- import App from './App';
+ import App from './src/screens/App';

// ...
```

## 4. Run proejct

Now check whether the code written above works well.

It'll probably work fine.

Since version 0.7 of react-native, an error may occur while running a newly created project.

The message \"launchPackager.command\" can't be opened appears.

In this case, please check [this post](/en/posts/2023/09/react-native-launch-packager-command-cant-be-opened) for a solution.

```bash
# ios test
yarn ios

# android test
yarn android
```

## Organizing

Today, we learned how to switch screens using react-navigation by writing simple code.

In the next post, what are the situations in which screen transition functions such as navigate, push, and replace of react-navigation are used?
Let's find out how to use it.
